# QccPack-Addon
A program wrapped up on QccPack.
The purpose is to apply SPECK and SPIHT encoders from the QccPack library
on data in the CAM atmospheric model. 

This program has two parts.
The first part provides an easy interface to perform SPECK and SPIHT 
encoding/decoding using QccPack.
The second part transforms data in a CAM atmospheric model into 
typical 2D/3D rectilinear data for easy processing.
