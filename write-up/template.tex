\title{SPIHT and SPECK Encoders on Scientific Data Sets}


%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
SPIHT and SPECK encoders were originally developed by the image processing community.
%
They provide good image compression while keep the distortions low.
%
We investigate the application of SPIHT and SPECK on scientific data sets here.
